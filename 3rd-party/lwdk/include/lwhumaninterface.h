 * lwhumaninterface -- Human Interface input/output with LightWave
 *
 * A device being connected is a state handled by the device and its underlying driving mechanism.
 * For example, a device may be powered on, but a bluetooth or network connection to it may not be
 * operational.  When the device is actually available to get data in/out of the LightWave Human
 * Interface system, then it should notify the system that the device is connected.
 * Similarly, if the device loses power (low batteries) or its communication with the underlying driving
 * mechanism is severed, then the LightWave Human Interface system should be told the device is disconnected.
 *
 * Starting and Stopping a device is handled independent of its behind-the-scenes connected state.
 * However, only a started device should be concerned with notifying the LightWave Human Interface
 * system of its connected state.  Therefore, once a device has been told to start, it must tell the the system
 * that it is connected before I/O can pass through it.  The device does not need to indicate when it is disconnected
 * after being told to stop, though.
 *
 * A device manager that is told to start should add devices for all those that it knows of at that time.
 * As devices come and go, they can be added/removed.
 * Each device that is added and started will be told to start.
 * Each device that is started and removed will be told to stop.
 *
 * There may be two ways to interpret configuaritons: 1) the user has a choice from the application; 2) the user manipualtes the
 * device directly.  The latter seems the most useful: a real world device may have a switch to change modes of operation;
 * a logical device, like a touch screen panel, may have a menu of choices known to the device.  Rarely, if ever, do I foresee
 * the user wanting to change the configuration from within LightWave.
