 * posSnap  some view plane.  One value is snapped to the nearest
 *      grid intersection in 3D while the other is not.
 *
 * deltaRaw vector from the initial mouse-down event to the current
 * deltaSnap    event location.  These are the difference between the
 *      current 'pos' values are the first one.
 *
 * dx, dy   screen movement in pixels.  This is the total raw mouse
 *      offset from the starting position.
 *
 * pxRaw/Snap   parametric translation values.  These are the mouse
 * pyRaw/Snap   offsets converted to values in model-space.  They provide
 *      a method for computing abstract distance measures from
 *      left/right and up/down mouse movement roughly scaled to
 *      the magnification of the viewport.
 *
 * axis     event axis.  All the points under the mouse location
 *      are along this axis through 'pos'.
 *
 * ax       screen coordinate system.  The ax vector points to the
 * ay       right on the screen, the ay vector points up the screen
 * az       and the az vector points into the screen.  Movement along
 *      each vector corresponds to approximately one pixel of
 *      screen-space movement.
 *
 * portAxis view axis which is 0, 1 or 2 for orthogonal views.  It
 *      is -1 for perspective views.
 *
 * viewNumber   which window view the the event came from (0 to 3).

/*
 * A LightWave viewport tool has the following handler functions.

 * done     destroy the instance when the user discards the tool.

 * draw     display a wireframe representation of the tool in a 3D
 *          viewport.  Typically this draws the handles.

 * help     return a text string to be displayed as a help tip for
 *          this tool.

 * dirty    return flag bit if either the wireframe or help string
 *          need to be refreshed.

 * count    return the number of handles.  If zero, then 'start' is
 *          used to set the initial handle point.

 * handle   return the 3D location and priority of handle 'i', or zero
 *          if the handle is currently invalid.

 * start    take an initial mouse-down position and return the index
 *          of the handle that should be dragged.

 * adjust   drag the given handle to a new location and return the
 *          index of the handle that should continue being dragged
 *          (often the same as the input).

 * down     process a mouse-down event.  If this function returns
 *          false, handle processing will be done instead of raw
 *          mouse event processing.

 * move     process a mouse-move event. This is only called if the
 *          down function returned true and the user is dragging.

 * up       process a mouse-up event.  This is only called if the down
 *          function returned true.

 * event    process a general event: DROP, RESET or ACTIVATE

 * panel    create and return a view-type xPanel for the tool instance.

 * undo     gets called when the user requests to perform an undo operation.
 *          return true to allow Lightwave's undo system to take care of it,
 *          or false to block it so that the tool can handle it accordingly.

 * redo     gets called when the user requests to perform a redo operation.
 *          return true to allow lightwave's undo system to take care of it,
 *          or false to block it so that the tool can handle it accordingly.
